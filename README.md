# CCWorldOfPAYBACK

- App is mixture of UIKit and SwiftUI in order to try and capture transition phase of moving from UIKit to SwiftUI as noted in README that's part of coding challenge.
- For multiple teams to be able to work on different features without much interference, I've split features into swift packages as well as some helping modules as: network, coordinator, ui components
- Two languages are added: english and german - as noted in readme, this app will be available worldwide. This should further be expanded
- MVVM pattern is used
- Some Unit tests and UI tests are implemented, but wider coverage should be executed in future
